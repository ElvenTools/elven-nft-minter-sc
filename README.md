🚨 Be aware that the Smart Contract doesn't have any audits. It has complete functionality for the first version, but it still needs some improvements. Test it first on the devnet/testnet. 🚨

**You can use [elven-tools-cli](https://github.com/ElvenTools/elven-tools-cli) for deployment and interactions!**

**You can use [elven-tools-dapp](https://github.com/ElvenTools/elven-tools-dapp) as your frontend dapp for minting process! (NextJS based app)**

### What is it?

You are reading about the Smart Contract designed for the Elrond blockchain. Its primary purpose is to provide a simple logic for minting and buying a previously configured collection of NFTs. It does it in a randomized way. Version 1 of it supports:

- issuing the collection token
- setting the create role
- pausing/unpausing the process
- random mint and distribution
- minting multiple NFTs in one transaction
- giveaway options
- possibility to split the process into drops/waves
- claiming the developer rewards
- changing basic setup where it is possible

Check the [abi](https://github.com/ElvenTools/elven-nft-minter-sc/blob/main/output/elven-nft-minter.abi.json) file for more information.

Also, check how simple it is to deploy and interact with it using [elven-tools-cli](https://github.com/ElvenTools/elven-tools-cli).

### Check out possible workflows

Examples of how you can configure your Smart Contract in a couple of scenarios and how to use the CLI to do this faster and more efficient: [www.elven.tools/docs/elven-tools-workflows.html](https://www.elven.tools/docs/elven-tools-workflows.html)

### All endpoints with short descriptions

For all commands, check out the docs: [www.elven.tools/docs/sc-endpoints.html](https://www.elven.tools/docs/sc-endpoints.html)

### Other ways of using it

You can always clone it and change it as you need. The best is to use the Elven Tools CLI tool, which can also be configured after changes. But nothing stops you from using the [erdpy](https://docs.elrond.com/sdk-and-tools/erdpy/erdpy/) and interacting with this Smart Contract. It is all up to you.
